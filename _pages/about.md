I am currently an astrophysicist at the [Center for Astrophysics &#124; Harvard & Smithsonian (CfA)](https://www.cfa.harvard.edu), working at the [Chandra X-ray Center](https://cxc.cfa.harvard.edu) in the [ACIS Operations Team](https://cxc.cfa.harvard.edu/acis). I previously held postdoctoral appointments at [MIT Kavli Institute](https://www.space.mit.edu), [NASA/Goddard Space Flight Center](https://www.nasa.gov/goddard/), and the CfA. I received my Bachelor of Science degree in physics from the [University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign](https://illinois.edu), and my Master of Science and doctoral degrees in astronomy and astrophysics at the [University of Chicago](https://www.uchicago.edu/).
