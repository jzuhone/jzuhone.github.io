I am currently an astrophysicist at the [Center for Astrophysics | Harvard & Smithsonian (CfA)](https://www.cfa.harvard.edu), working at the [Chandra X-ray Center](https://cxc.cfa.harvard.edu) in the [ACIS Operations Team](https://cxc.cfa.harvard.edu/acis). I previously held postdoctoral appointments at [MIT Kavli Institute](https://www.space.mit.edu), [NASA/Goddard Space Flight Center](https://www.nasa.gov/goddard/), and the CfA. I received my Bachelor of Science degree in physics from the [University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign](https://illinois.edu), and my Master of Science and doctoral degrees in astronomy and astrophysics at the [University of Chicago](https://www.uchicago.edu/).

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
