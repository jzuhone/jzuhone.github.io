### Overview

The Advanced CCD Imaging Spectrometer (ACIS) camera on the *Chandra* spacecraft is sensitive to damage from protons in
the solar wind with kinetic energies of ~100 keV, which can be reflected by the *Chandra* mirrors onto the CCDs and
increase charge transfer inefficiency (CTI), degrading the spectral resolution of the CCDs. When solar storms occur, it
is sometimes necessary to safe ACIS (shutting it down and moving it out of the focal plane) to prevent this radiation
damage. 

Shutdowns can be manually executed if the *Chandra* project judges the radiation environment to be too dangerous. There is also a mechanism for an autonomous shutdown. Earlier in the mission,

### Storm-related memos I have written

Any time there is a significant solar storm that causes actions to be taken by the ACIS Ops team, a memo is written. The following are memos I have written concerning some of these events. 

* [March 2023 Storm](../../assets/pdf/MAR2023_memo.pdf)
* [November 2023 Storm](../../assets/pdf/NOV2023_memo.pdf)
* [March 2024 Storm](../../assets/pdf/MAR2024_memo.pdf)
* [October 2024 Storm](../../assets/pdf/OCT2024_memo.pdf)
