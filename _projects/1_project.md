The latest generation of X-ray telescopes, including *Chandra* and
*XMM-Newton*, have revealed the existence of sharp surface brightness
discontinuities which betray the existence of sharp density jumps in
the intracluster medium (ICM) Spectral analysis demonstrates that
these are also jumps in temperature, with the denser side of the front
having a lower temperature. These features have been dubbed "cold
fronts" (for reviews see [Markevitch & Vikhlinin 2007](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2007PhR...443....1M) and ZuHone & Roediger 2016). Simulations
indicate that cold fronts may form from merging activity, whether by
ram-pressure stripping or "ram-pressure slingshots" of cool, dense
gas. Cold fronts should be susceptible to heat conduction, which would
elminate the sharp temperature gradient on a short timescale, and
fluid instabilities, such as Kelvin-Helmholtz (K-H), which would
disrupt their smooth appearance.

You can also put regular text between your rows of images, even citations {% cite einstein1950meaning %}.
Say you wanted to write a bit about your project before you posted the rest of the images.
You describe how you toiled, sweated, _bled_ for your project, and then... you reveal its glory in the next row of images.

<div class="row justify-content-sm-center">
    <div class="col-sm-8 mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.liquid path="assets/img/6.jpg" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm-4 mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.liquid path="assets/img/11.jpg" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
</div>
<div class="caption">
    You can also have artistically styled 2/3 + 1/3 images, like these.
</div>

The code is simple.
Just wrap your images with `<div class="col-sm">` and place them inside `<div class="row">` (read more about the <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.4/layout/grid/">Bootstrap Grid</a> system).
To make images responsive, add `img-fluid` class to each; for rounded corners and shadows use `rounded` and `z-depth-1` classes.
Here's the code for the last row of images above:

{% raw %}

```html
<div class="row justify-content-sm-center">
  <div class="col-sm-8 mt-3 mt-md-0">
    {% include figure.liquid path="assets/img/6.jpg" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
  </div>
  <div class="col-sm-4 mt-3 mt-md-0">
    {% include figure.liquid path="assets/img/11.jpg" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
  </div>
</div>
```

{% endraw %}
